## Preparing and mining a questionnaire data set
## We use the Adult data set from the UCI machine learning repository 
## provided by package arules.  The data originates from the U.S.
## census bureau database and contains 48842 instances with 14 attributes like age, work class,
## education, etc. In the original applications of the data, the attributes were used to predict
## the income level of individuals. We added the attribute income with levels small and large,
## representing an income of  USD 50,000 and > USD 50,000, respectively. This data is
## included in arules as the data set AdultUCI.

data("AdultUCI")
dim(AdultUCI)
AdultUCI[1:3,]

## AdultUCI contains a mixture of categorical and metric attributes 
## and needs some preparations before it can be transformed into 
## transaction data suitable for association mining. 

## First, we remove the two attributes fnlwgt and education-num. 
## The first attribute is a weight calculated by the creators of 
## the data set from control data provided by the Population Division
## of the U.S. census bureau. 
## The second removed attribute is just a numeric representation of
## the attribute education which is also part of the data set.

AdultUCI[["fnlwgt"]] <- NULL
AdultUCI[["education-num"]] <- NULL


## Next, we need to map the four remaining metric attributes 
## (age, hours-per-week, capital-gain and capital-loss) to ordinal attributes 
##  by building suitable categories. 
## We divide the attributes age and hours-per-week into suitable categories 
## using knowledge about typical age groups and working hours. 
##  For the two capital related attributes, we create a category called
##  None for cases which have no gains/losses. Then we further divide 
## the group with gains/losses at their median into the two categories Low and High.

AdultUCI[[ "age"]] <- ordered(cut(AdultUCI[[ "age"]], c(15,25,45,65,100)),
   labels = c("Young", "Middle-aged", "Senior", "Old"));

AdultUCI[[ "hours-per-week"]] <- ordered(cut(AdultUCI[[ "hours-per-week"]],
 c(0,25,40,60,168)), labels = c("Part-time", "Full-time", "Over-time", "Workaholic"));

AdultUCI[[ "capital-gain"]] <- ordered(cut(AdultUCI[[ "capital-gain"]],
 c(-Inf,0,median(AdultUCI[[ "capital-gain"]][AdultUCI[[ "capital-gain"]]>0]),Inf)),
 labels = c("None", "Low", "High"));

AdultUCI[[ "capital-loss"]] <- ordered(cut(AdultUCI[[ "capital-loss"]],
  c(-Inf,0, median(AdultUCI[[ "capital-loss"]][AdultUCI[[ "capital-loss"]]>0]),Inf)),
  labels = c("none", "low", "high"));


## Now, the data can be automatically recoded as a binary incidence matrix 
## by coercing the data set to transactions.

Adult <- as(AdultUCI, "transactions")
Adult
summary(Adult)


## To see which items are important in the data set we can use the itemFrequencyPlot().
## To reduce the number of items, we only plot the item frequency for items
##   with a support greater than 50% (or 10%)
itemFrequencyPlot(Adult, support = 0.5, cex.names=0.8)
itemFrequencyPlot(Adult, support = 0.1, cex.names=0.8)

## Next, we call the function apriori() to fnd all rules 
## (the default association type for apriori()) with 
## a minimum support of 1% and a confidence of 0.6.
rules <- apriori(Adult, parameter = list(support = 0.01, confidence = 0.6))
rules;
summary(rules);


## As typical for association rule mining, the number of rules found is huge. 
## To analyze these rules, for example, subset() can be used to produce 
## separate subsets of rules for each item which resulted form the variable 
## income in the right-hand-side of the rule. 
##  At the same time we require that the lift measure exceeds 1:2.

rulesIncomeSmall <- subset(rules, subset = rhs %in% "income=small" & lift > 1.2)
rulesIncomeLarge <- subset(rules, subset = rhs %in% "income=large" & lift > 1.2)

## For comparison, we inspect for both sets the three rules with the highest
## confidence (using SORT()).

inspect(head(SORT(rulesIncomeSmall, by = "confidence"), n = 3))
inspect(head(SORT(rulesIncomeLarge, by = "confidence"), n = 3))

## From the rules we see that workers in the private sector working part-time 
## or in the service industry tend to have a small income 
## while persons with high capital gain who are born in the US tend to have a large income.
